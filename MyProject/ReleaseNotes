TM4C123_CProject_v1p2   29 October 2014
  Fix path variable to inc directory in current project so changing the project
    name doesn't break the path
  Removed the built-in GCC cross compiler from the list of providers for the
    build paths and directories, eliminated a spurious error message
  Modified startup_TM4C.s so that the Usage Fault, Bus Fault, and Memory
    Management Fault exceptions are enabled. Better for debugging.
